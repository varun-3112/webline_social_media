## About

This is an RESTfull implementation of an order processing app based on Northwind database schema from Microsoft.
The goal of the project is to 
- Highlight techniques of making and securing a REST full app using [SpringBoot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot)
- How to consume an RESTfull service and make an HTML5 based Single Page App using [Angular 4+](https://github.com/angular/angular)

### Features of the Project
* Backend
  * Token Based Security (using Spring security)
  * API documentation and Live Try-out links with Swagger 
  * In Memory DB with H2 
  * Using JPA and JDBC template to talk to relational database
  * How to request and respond for paginated data 

* Frontend
  * Organizing Components, Services, Directives, Pages etc in an Angular App
  * How to chain RxJS Observables (by making sequntial AJAX request- its different that how you do with promises)
  * Techniques to Lazy load Data (Infinite Scroll)
  * Techniques to load large data set in a data-table but still keeping DOM footprint less
  * Routing and guarding pages that needs authentication
  * Basic visulaization

* Build
  * How to build all in one app that includes (database, sample data, RESTfull API, Auto generated API Docs, frontend and security)
  * Portable app, Ideal for dockers, cloud hosting.

## In Memory DB (H2)
I have included an in-memory database for the application. Database schema and sample data for the app is created everytime the app starts, and gets destroyed after the app stops, so the changes made to to the database are persistent only as long as the app is running
<br/>
Creation of database schema and data are done using sql scripts that Springs runs automatically. 
To modify the database schema or the data you can modify [schema.sql](./src/main/resources/schema.sql) and [data.sql](./src/main/resources/data.sql) which can be found at `/src/main/resources`

## Spring security
Security is **enabled** by default, to disable, you must comment [this line](./src/main/java/com/app/config/SecurityConfig.java#L15) in `src/main/java/com/config/SecurityConfig.java`<br/>
When security is enabled, none of the REST API will be accessesble directly.

To test security access `http://localhost:9119/version` API and you should get a forbidden/Access denied error. 


### Build Backend (SpringBoot Java)
```bash
# Maven Build : Navigate to the root folder where pom.xml is present 
mvn clean install

### Start the API and WebUI server
```bash
# Start the server (8095)
# port and other configurations for API servere is in [./src/main/resources/application.properties](/src/main/resources/application.properties) file

# If you build with maven jar location will be 
java -jar ./target/app-1.0.0.jar


### Accessing Application
Cpmponent         | URL                                      | Credentials
---               | ---                                      | ---
MySQL Database       |  jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/social_media        |  User Name:`root`,password:`root`   
Swagger (API Ref) |  http://localhost:9119/swagger-ui/index.html   | 
Swagger Spec      |  http://localhost:8095/v3/api-docs          |
